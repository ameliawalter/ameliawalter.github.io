# Quality Assurance Specialist

Welcome to my personal website where you can read about my skills, experience and goals.

I am continuously developing my quality assurance skills, especially technical ones, to be a better and better software testing specialist. 
# Currently I'm working as automation tester and I would like to continue my professional development in this direction.
However, automation is only a tool in a way to achieve quality. Good requirements and test cases engineering, business knowledge or soft skills development are also a "must" in my development journey.
